# Contribution

- I accept contribution :)
- The rules is simple: i can accept it, or refuse it depending on
  - Is the feature is in the goal of this backup application ? (i don't accept contribution to make coffee when backup is made)
  - Is the feature is write as i think it should be write (very very subjective, but i will comment your pull request to tell you how i think it should be written)

If you want to add a new feature, the better way is to ask me if i'm not already made it and if i accept pull request on it before starting.

PS: I know that this make me a Benevolent Dictor for Life, but if i have many perfect contribution, maybe that can be changed :)
