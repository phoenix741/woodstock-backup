# Contribution

- I accept contributions :)
- The rules are simple: I can accept or refuse depending on
  - Is the feature in line with the goal of this backup application ? (I don't accept contributions to make coffee when backup is made)
  - Is the feature written the way I think it should be written (very very subjective, but I will comment your pull request to tell you how I think it should be written)

If you want to add a new feature, the best way is to ask me first if I haven't already made it and if I would accept pull request on it before starting.

PS: I know that this make me a Benevolent Dictor for Life, but if I receive a lot of great contributions, maybe that can be changed :)
