To perform backups, you need to install an agent on your computer. Please download the agent
corresponding to your operating system.

After downloading, you will have a zip file containing the following:

* `config.yml`: The configuration file for the agent.
* Certificates necessary for authentication.

Extract the contents of the zip file to a folder of your choice. Download the agent from the release page: <https://gogs.shadoware.org/ShadowareOrg/woodstock-backup/releases> and install it.
